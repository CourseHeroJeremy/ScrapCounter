# ScrapCounter
A front-end tally counter for easily tracking multiple counts

The idea for this app came while I was at work. We use multiple clicker devices to track how much scrap we dispose of. These devices are prone to jamming, wear, double-clicking, and require labels to describe the reason for disposing of them (eg cracks, contamination, etc). With this, I hoped to make life easier for myself and other operators with a reliable and flexible tally counter program.
